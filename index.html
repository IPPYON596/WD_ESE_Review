    <h1 class="abouth">About Youth Department</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="aboutp"> <b>The Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports</b> was initially set up as the Department of Sports in 1982 at the time of organization of the IX Asian Games in New Delhi . Its name was changed to the Department of Youth affairs & sports during celebration of the International Youth Year, 1985. It became a Ministry on 27th May,2000. Subsequently, the Ministry has been bifurcated in Deptt. of Youth Affairs and Deptt. of Sports under two separate Secretaries w.e.f. 30th April,2008. The specific subjects being dealt with by these two Departments are contained in the Order of the Govt. of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.
        
        
        The Youth, i.e. those falling within the age group of 15-29 years constitutes nearly 40% of the total population of India. This group which is the most vibrant and dynamic segment of the country’s population constitutes potentially its most valuable human resource. To optimally tap their constructive and creative energies, the Department pursues the twin objectives of personality building and nation building, i.e. developing the personality of youth and involving them in various nation-building activities. As most of the issues concerning young people are the functions of other Ministries/Departments, like Education, Employment & Training, Health and Family Welfare, etc. the role of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports is to act as a facilitator and catalytic agent.</p>

                <p>MoYAS and UNDP/ UNV agreed on strengthening youth volunteering in India through a joint project titled “Strengthening NYKS and NSS”. The project is aimed at providing catalytic support to the Youth Volunteer Schemes of the MoYAS and intended to facilitate youth participation and voice in peace and sustainable development programmes in order to realization of full social, economic and human potential of youth. The primary objectives of the Project are:

                    Strengthen National Youth Volunteer Infrastructure of Department of Youth Affairs (DYA);
                    Strengthen capacity of rural youth clubs for increased and diversified opportunities for youth volunteers;
                    Increase participation, recognition and contribution of youth volunteers in development process.
                    The project “Strengthening NYKS and NSS” adopted a collaborative approach and included key partners in designing and implementing it.
                    
                    Youth volunteerism promoted as a modality for social mobilization and outreach at district and sub-district levels in 29 pilot districts during Phase-I (2014- 17). The project in phase II (2018-20 & extended upto June, 2022) has now been expanded to 58 districts of India with national UN Volunteer District Youth Coordinators (UNV DYCs) placed. UNV District Youth Coordinators have energised the work of NYKS in the 58 districts and has led to formation of additional youth clubs and innovative ways of engaging youth in volunteering for community development, skills development, and awareness generation on Government of India’s programmes at grassroots levels.</p>
